First you will need a Darksky API key for this app to work. you can get one here

[DarkSky API](https://darksky.net/dev)

Python 3.7 is recommended, it was developed against that version I can not garuntee older versions will work yet but 3.6 should be okay

To run this app create a python virtual environment

once that environment is activated run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

then run

```
python app.py
```
